# patent_classification_using_LLM
Task:  Use the LLaMA 3.2 1B parameter model. Quantize the model to 4-bit precision for efficiency. Fine-tune the model using the CCDV Patent Classification Dataset to classify patents into relevant categories as defined in the dataset. Deploy the fine-tuned model using vLLM and serve it on port 9000
